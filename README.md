# Wordwave
CSE 201 Project

When it comes to writing code to impliment your requirements, the easiest way to go about it would (probably) be to push your own CSS or JS files (after pulling them) to here, and edit 'index.html' to impliment your changes. 

If you need me to do anything, just text me.

## Install (local machine)
Clone repository to local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/JayOliverio/Wordwave/
```
Open the folder in VSCode, ensure you have the 'Live Server' extention installed (if not you can get it from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
Once installed, click the 'Go Live' button in the bottom-right of the window to locally host the website in your default browser.
After that, click ```intex.html``` to access the main page.

## Installation (remote server)
Clone the repository to your local machine and change to its directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/JayOliverio/Wordwave/
cd wordwave
```
Upload it to a remote server you have access to:
```
scp * <your-username>@<server-address>:~/public_html/
```
In a browser navigate to ```<server-address>/~<user>/intex.html```
